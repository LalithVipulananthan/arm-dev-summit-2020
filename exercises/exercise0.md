# Exercise 0: Introduction (or some general points to note)

1. The VMs provided for use by Tier IV do not have Internet access, and copy/paste functionality is not available, so all commands will need to manually typed out.

2. For the majority of the time, we will be using two terminal windows.

## Note   

The number of terminals required when using Autoware scales with the complexity of the overall system and can be as many as 10-12 in an actual autonomous vehicle!

3. Although it is perfectly acceptable for workshop participants to use any terminal application that is included with the base install of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the [Terminator application](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) has been installed for the purposes of the workshop and will be used in any videos accompanying the workshop.

- When running commands in multiple terminal Windows, the broadcast function of Terminator can be used:
    - Press Alt + A to turn broadcast on (all keyboard input will appear in all windows)
    - Press Alt + O to turn broadcast off
