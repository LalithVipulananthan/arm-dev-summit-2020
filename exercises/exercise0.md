# Exercise 0: Introduction (or how we're going to be doing things)

1. For the most, two terminal windows will be required for these exercises (the number of terminals scales with the complexity of the overall system and can be as many as 10-12 in an actual autonomous vehicle!). 

2. Whilst those following these exercises can use their preferred terminal, the [Terminator application](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) will be used in any videos accompanying the workshop, and any terminal screenshots in the exercises will be taken from Terminator.

3. When using RViz and playing a rosbag, we will often switch from the default 2D TopDownOrth view type to the 3D ThirdPersonFollower view type. This process is described in detail in Exercise 2, but all subsequent exercises will simply say "Switch to ThirdPersonFollower view", so the steps to switch view type are included here for reference purposes.

- In the Views panel on the left side of the window, click the Type dropdown box and select "ThirdPersonFollower"
- Double-click the Target Frame value and select "base_link"
- Click the “Zero” button
