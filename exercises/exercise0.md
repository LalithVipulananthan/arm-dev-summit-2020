# Exercise 0: Introduction (or how we're going to be doing things)

Throughout these exercises, two terminal windows will be required to run Autoware (the number of terminals is dependent on the complexity of the overall system). You're welcome to do this in whichever way you prefer, but we're going to use the [Terminator application](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) and all exercises going forward will show Terminator screenshots.
