# Exercise 0: Introduction (or how we're going to be doing things)

1. For the most, two terminal windows will be required for these exercises (the number of terminals scales with the complexity of the overall system and can be as many as 10-12 in an actual autonomous vehicle!). 

2. Whilst those following these exercises can use their preferred terminal, the [Terminator application](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) will be included with the VMs provided for the workshop and will also be used in any videos accompanying the workshop.
