# Exercise 0: Introduction (or some general points to note)

1. The VMs provided for use by Tier IV do not have Internet access, and copy/paste functionality is not available, so all commands will need to manually typed out.

2. For the majority of the time, we will be using two terminal windows.

## Note   

The number of terminals required when using Autoware scales with the complexity of the overall system and can be as many as 10-12 in an actual autonomous vehicle!

3. Although it is perfectly acceptable for workshop participants to use any terminal application that is included with the base install of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the [Terminator application](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) has been installed for the purposes of the workshop and will be used in any videos accompanying the workshop. 

    Here are some basic Terminator commands that will come in useful during the presentation:

      - To split windows in Terminator
          - Press Ctrl + Shift + O to split a terminal horizontally
          - Press Ctrl + Shift + E to split a terminal vertically
      - To move between terminals
          - Press Alt + Left/Right/Up/Down arrow keys
      - When running commands in multiple terminal Windows, the broadcast function of Terminator can be used:
          - Press Alt + A to turn broadcast on (all keyboard input will appear in all windows)
          - Press Alt + O to turn broadcast off
      - To cancel a running command
          - Press Ctrl + C
      - To close the current terminal
          - Press Ctrl + SÂ­hift + W
